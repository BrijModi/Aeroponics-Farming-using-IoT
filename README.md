‚Ä¢ Automated Nutrient Misting: Delivers a nutrient-rich mist directly to plant roots at controlled intervals.

‚Ä¢ Real-time Environmental Monitoring: Continuously tracks key parameters including temperature, humidity, gas levels, and light intensity.

‚Ä¢ Nutrient and Water Level Management: Monitors nutrient concentration (TDS) and water levels to ensure a healthy solution is always available.

‚Ä¢ Remote Control & Alerts: Integrates with the Blynk platform to allow for remote monitoring, real-time alerts for critical events, and manual override of system components.

‚Ä¢ Automated Climate Control: A cooling fan automatically activates to regulate temperature and humidity within the enclosure.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack -

This project was built using a combination of hardware components and software platforms.

Hardware -

‚Ä¢ Microcontroller: ESP32

‚Ä¢ Sensors: DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity), BH1750 (Light Intensity), MQ135 (Gas), Analog TDS Sensor (Nutrients), Soil Moisture Sensor (used for water level detection)

‚Ä¢ Actuators: Relay Module, Water Misting Pump, Cooling Fan

Software & Platform -

‚Ä¢ Programming Language: C++ (for Arduino/ESP32)

‚Ä¢ IoT Platform: Blynk App

üîÅ Working Principle - 

The IoT-based aeroponics system operates as a closed-loop control mechanism, dynamically adjusting its operations based on real-time sensor data. The system's operation can be broken down into the following stages:

‚Ä¢ Data Acquisition: Sensors continuously monitor the environment. The DHT22 measures temperature and humidity, the BH1750 measures sunlight, and a gas sensor measures air quality. For the nutrient solution, a TDS sensor measures concentration, and a soil moisture sensor is adapted to detect water levels to prevent the misting system from running dry.

‚Ä¢ Central Processing: The ESP32 microcontroller receives all sensor data and processes it in real time. Based on pre-set thresholds, it determines if any action is needed. For example, if the temperature exceeds a certain level, the cooling fan is activated.

‚Ä¢ Automated Control: A relay module, acting as a switch, controls the water pump and DC fan. Misting intervals and fan operations are automatically triggered based on the data from the sensors.

‚Ä¢ IoT Feedback Loop: The Blynk platform allows for remote monitoring and interaction. Users can view real-time data, receive notifications for critical events, and even override the automated controls.

üöß Challenges Faced - 

Developing this project presented several challenges that required creative problem-solving:

‚Ä¢ Integration Complexity: Integrating various sensors and actuators with the ESP32 and ensuring they all communicated correctly with the Blynk platform was a significant challenge. Ensuring each component had a stable power supply was also a critical task.

‚Ä¢ Power Management: Providing stable power to multiple components with different voltage requirements (e.g., 3.3V for sensors, 5V for relays, 9V for the fan, etc.) was a core challenge. We addressed this by designing a custom power supply unit with a step-down transformer and buck converters to ensure voltage stability and efficiency.

üöÄ Future Scope - 

The project's design provides a strong foundation for future development and scalability. Some key areas for enhancement include:

‚Ä¢ Advanced Data Analytics: Integrating machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict plant growth, enabling the system to proactively adjust conditions for optimal yield. This can lead to a more intelligent system that fine-tunes parameters over time.

‚Ä¢ Sustainable Power: The system's design can be adapted to integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, which would reduce operational costs and environmental impact.

‚Ä¢ Vertical & Multi-Crop Scalability: The current design can be expanded to a vertical farming setup, allowing multiple plant trays to be stacked, significantly increasing crop production in a limited space. The system could also be customized to support a wider range of crops by allowing users to change nutrient solution recipes and control parameters based on specific plant requirements.

‚Ä¢Enhanced Connectivity: The IoT framework can be expanded to include global connectivity, enabling remote data access and control from any location, facilitating research and collaboration.
